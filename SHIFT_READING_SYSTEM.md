# Comprehensive Shift Reading System

## Overview

Based on the provided spreadsheet structure, I've implemented a comprehensive
shift reading system that accurately reflects the real-world petrol station
operations with 4 dispensers, each having 2 pumps (MS & HSD), pump testing
(Shift I only), and own use calculations.

## Structure Implemented

### 1. Dispensers Configuration

-  **4 Dispensers**: DSM-An1, DSM-Bn1, DSM-An2, DSM-Bn2
-  **8 Total Pumps**: Each dispenser has 2 pumps (MS and HSD)
-  **Real-world naming convention**: Matches industry standards

### 2. Data Fields per Pump

#### Input Fields:

-  **Closing Reading**: Manual input by operator
-  **Opening Reading**: Manual input by operator
-  **Pump Test Qty**: Manual input (Only visible for Shift I)
-  **Own Use Qty**: Manual input for internal consumption

#### Calculated Fields:

-  **Dispensed Qty**: `closing_reading - opening_reading`
-  **Net Dispensed Qty**: `dispensed_qty - pump_test_qty - own_use_qty`
-  **Amount**: `net_dispensed_qty × rate_per_litre`

### 3. Features

#### Table Layout:

-  Clean, professional table matching the spreadsheet format
-  Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
-  Color-coded fuel types (MS: Blue, HSD: Green)
-  Grouped by dispenser with proper rowspan handling

#### Calculations:

-  **Real-time calculation** of all derived values
-  **Auto-totaling** across all pumps and dispensers
-  **Pump Test handling** only for Shift I (first shift)
-  **Validation** to ensure data integrity

#### Summary Display:

-  Total Dispensed Quantity across all pumps
-  Total Pump Test (Shift I only)
-  Total Own Use consumption
-  Total Net Dispensed (revenue-generating)
-  Total Amount in rupees

### 4. Business Logic

#### Shift-Specific Rules:

-  **Shift I (1)**: Includes pump test columns and calculations
-  **Shift II & III (2,3)**: No pump test, simplified interface
-  **All Shifts**: Include own use tracking

#### Fuel Pricing:

-  **MS (Motor Spirit)**: ₹93.26 per litre (default)
-  **HSD (High Speed Diesel)**: ₹93.26 per litre (default)
-  Configurable through fuel price management

### 4. Shift-Specific Features

#### Shift I (6AM - 2PM):

-  **Automatic Pump Test**: Each pump automatically gets 5L pump test quantity
-  **Pump test inputs visible**: Operators can adjust pump test quantities
-  **Net calculation**: Amount = (Dispensed - Pump Test - Own Use) × Rate

#### Shift II & III (2PM - 10PM & 10PM - 6AM):

-  **No pump test**: Pump test quantities default to 0
-  **Pump test inputs hidden**: Not applicable for these shifts
-  **Net calculation**: Amount = (Dispensed - Own Use) × Rate

#### Paste Functionality:

-  **Shift-aware import**: When importing data to Shift I, pump test is
   automatically set to 5L
-  **Auto-calculation**: Net dispensed and amounts adjust automatically after
   import

### 5. **Dynamic Fuel Price Integration**

#### Real-time Price Updates:

-  **Automatic Reactivity**: Rate per liter automatically updates when fuel
   prices change
-  **Live Recalculation**: All amounts recalculate instantly when prices update
-  **API Integration Ready**: Designed to work with live fuel price APIs or
   databases

#### Implementation:

```typescript
// Fuel prices passed as props
<ComprehensiveShiftReading
   fuelPrices={{ MS: 93.26, HSD: 85.5 }}
   // ... other props
/>;

// Component automatically updates when fuelPrices change
useEffect(() => {
   // Updates all pump rates and recalculates amounts
   updateAllPumpRates(fuelPrices);
}, [fuelPrices.MS, fuelPrices.HSD]);
```

#### Example Integration:

```typescript
// Fetch live prices from API
const [fuelPrices, setFuelPrices] = useState({ MS: 0, HSD: 0 });

useEffect(() => {
   fetchLiveFuelPrices().then(setFuelPrices);
}, []);

// Prices automatically reflect in shift reading
```

### 5. Data Flow

```
Input: Opening + Closing Readings
↓
Calculate: Dispensed Qty = Closing - Opening
↓
Input: Pump Test + Own Use
↓
Calculate: Net Dispensed = Dispensed - Pump Test - Own Use
↓
Calculate: Amount = Net Dispensed × Rate
↓
Summary: Totals across all pumps
```

### 6. Interface Design

#### Table Structure:

```
| Dispenser | Product | Closing | Opening | Dispensed | Pump Test* | Own Use | Net Dispensed | Rate | Amount |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|------------|---------|---------------|------|---------|
| DSM-An1   | MS      | [input] | [input] | [calc]    | [input]*   | [input] | [calc]        | 93.26| [calc]  |
|           | HSD     | [input] | [input] | [calc]    | [input]*   | [input] | [calc]        | 93.26| [calc]  |
| DSM-Bn1   | MS      | [input] | [input] | [calc]    | [input]*   | [input] | [calc]        | 93.26| [calc]  |
|           | HSD     | [input] | [input] | [calc]    | [input]*   | [input] | [calc]        | 93.26| [calc]  |
```

\*Pump Test column only visible for Shift I

#### User Experience:

-  **Intuitive data entry**: Tabular format familiar to operators
-  **Visual feedback**: Color-coded fuel types and calculated fields
-  **Error prevention**: Real-time validation and calculation
-  **Mobile friendly**: Responsive table design

### 7. Technical Implementation

#### Components:

-  All pump test quantities must be ≥ 0
-  Own use quantities must be ≥ 0

#### Data Integrity:

-  Automatic calculation prevents manual errors
-  Real-time validation feedback

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to **Dashboard → Shift Management**
2. Select or create a shift
3. Go to **"Readings"** tab
4. Enter opening and closing readings for each pump
5. Add pump test quantities (Shift I only)
6. Enter own use quantities
7. Review calculated totals
8. Save the shift reading

The system will automatically calculate all derived values and provide
comprehensive totals for management review and reporting.
